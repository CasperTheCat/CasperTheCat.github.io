           <h2>Style</h2>
           <p>For my project, I propose a silhouette style animation reminiscent of shadow puppetry. I want to explore this style as it has an inheritant minimalist simplicity that I really feel gives an ambience.</p>
           <p>It is worth noting that I will be doing this in 3D as I feel that I can work better in a 3D setting and I feel it will allow for a more fluid end result.</p>

               <h2>First Test</h2>
               <p>This was my proof of concept video, total scene setup and rendering time came in at just under 3 hours. Most of this was due to me trying to work out the best workflow for the rest of the project. I also needed to learn about Maya 2017's render layer overrides to get the silhouette material applied to all objects globally.</p>

               <h2>Second Test</h2>
               <p>This is a continuation on the exploration done previously, this took under 2 hours including planning to get this rendered into 5 passes and composited. In hindsight, I could actually have used one pass and it would have saved a lot of time on the compositng side.</p>

           <h2>Style Variants</h2>
           <p>I played with a few style choices including photoreal, but that would be unfeasible in the given time frame as the rendering along would end up taking around 300 hours.</p>

               <h2>Inverted Ambient Occlusion</h2>
               <p>Ambient occlusion is normally used for art direction to darken occluded areas for effect, I inverted this to keep the silhouette feel. I like this look a lot and the render time isn't too bad </p>

               <h2>Photorealistic</h2>
               <p>Photorealistic scene that takes around 6 minutes per full HD frame. This can be done faster with denoiser though.</p>

               <h2>Inverted Ambient Occlusion VFX Test</h2>
               <p>Exploring some VFX that were not possible with a silhouettes. Honestly, I feel like the inverted colour doesn't look that good in motion. Visual issue at the top of the frame is a composite issue.</p>

               <h2>Photoreal VFX Test</h2>
               <p>Same VFX but using physically accurate shaders. I think this looks better than the aforementioned version.</p>
