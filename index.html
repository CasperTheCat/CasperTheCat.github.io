            <h2>A little about myself</h2>
            <p>Born in Scotland, I am a computer science student at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.</p>
            <p>I started programming back in 2006 with BASIC and later scripting in Bethesda's Oblivion.</p>
            <p>
                In 2011, I started using the Cryengine SDK after playing Crysis 2 and loving the fidelity of it. I also
                ended up modding in Skyrim.
            </p>
            <p>I learned Python, HTML5 and CSS3 in 2012 at Cambridge High School. And continued mod games through my High School years but didn't really make anything noteworthy</p>
            <p>
                I was fortunate to join a startup in 2014 and attain one of ten computer science scholarships to Waikato University. During my
                time at <a class="undrln" href="http://nyriad.com/">Nyriad</a>, I learned C++ and CUDA. I also learned how
                to peer program and work in an agile development environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a game project for a paper at Waikato, I took a role of artist due to my want to learn art. I also setup and managed the
                <a href="https://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> source control server.
                About half way through our project, the team was able to take a trip up to the Auckland University of
                Technology to do motion capture where I worked with MotionBuilder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since late 2015, I have been learning computer graphics. I managed a basic Direct3D11 implementation in early
                december and a basic Vulkan implementation in late February 2016. Since then I have toyed with raytracer implementations
                and have done a more recent Vulkan implementation for a paper at Waikato.
            </p>
            <p>In the latter half of 2016, I tutored Game Design at Waikato and attained Citizenship of New Zealand.</p>
