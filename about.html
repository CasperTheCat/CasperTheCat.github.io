            <h2>A little about myself</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Chris. I am a computer science student at the University of Waikato in New Zealand and I hail from Scotland. I emigrated to New Zealand in August 2011 and almost have dual nationality.</p>
            <p>I started programming back in 2009 with BASIC and later scripting in Oblivion. I remember loving the openness of creating programs however simple they were back then.</p>
            <p> In 2011, I started using the Cryengine SDK after playing Crysis 2 and loving the fidelity of it. I also ended up modding in Skyrim and learning how the basics of object orientation worked even though I didn't know what it was at the time.</p>
            <p>I learned Python, HTML5 and CSS3 in 2012 at Cambridge High School. I was also taught far more about programming concepts that I missed by self teaching.</p>
            <p>I was forturnate to join a startup in 2014 and attain one of ten scholarships to Waikato University. During my time at <a class="undrln" href="http://nyriad.com/">Nyriad</a>, I learned C++ and CUDA.
            I also learned how to peer program and work under an agile development environment</p>
            <p>As a project for a paper at Waikato, I took a role as both an artist and a programmer due to us deciding to make a game for our project and my want to learn art. I also setup and managed the
            <a href="https://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> source control server.
             About half way through our project, the team was able to take a trip up to the Auckland University of Technology to do motion capture. As an artist, I used Autodesk Maya, Mudbox and MotionBuilder.</p>
            <p>Since late 2015, I have resolved to learn as much as I can about computer graphics. I managed a basic Direct3D11 implementation in early december and a basic Vulkan implementation in late February 2016.</p>

            <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

            <h3>What languages can you use?</h3>
            <p>I mainly use C++ or CUDA when appropriate. I can also use Java, Python, C# and some Haskell.</p>

            <h3>What is your favourite operating system?</h3>
            <p>Currently CentOS 7. I'm using Windows 10 on my desktop while I wait for a ZBrush update though. It seems, to me at least, that Linux offers much more flexibility.</p>

            <h3>What programs do you use daily?</h3>
            <p>In terms of standard user programs, I use Spotify for most of my music and I use Chrome as my primary browser. For productivity, I use Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 and vim on Linux. I also use ZBrush 4R7 for sculpting and Autodesk Maya for rendering and simulation.</p>

            <h3>Which renderer?</h3>
            <p>I've tried a lot of them and I like Pixar's Renderman the most. I also like Cycles because I can automate batch renders with it</p>

            <h3>Do you play sports?</h3>
            <p>I used to play rugby for Ross Sutherland when I lived in Scotland. Since emigrating, I've done kayaking and martial arts but now I just lift weights.</p>

            <h3>What type of music do you listen to?</h3>
            <p>I listen a lot of different genres and it really depends on what I'm doing. I mainly EDM or remixes while working because I don't have to concentrate.</p>
